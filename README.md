# LSTM-Fencing-est.-Symposium-2023
Lars' MatLab Code for making an LSTM/CV System for Fencing Priority. Work is as recent as the Baylor Symposium 2023


EDIT 25 NOVEMBER 2025 - This project has been long ended, and the code was never uploaded (largely because it was dysfunctional). If you need guidance on this subject matter, contact me via here and I can give some helpful tips and tricks.
